            <h2>"The universe's best lightsabers in one place"</h2>
            <h3>About us</h3>
            <p>
                My Workshop, located in the Black Spire Outpost on the Outer Rim planet Batuu, presented itself as the front office for the 'Savi & Son Salvage'. Me and my Gatherers, who admired the Jedi Order and had faith in the the Force, secretly operated a lightsaber workshop within despite the First Order occupation.
            </p>
            <h3>Where are we located?</h3>
            <p>
                The Savi & Son Salvage company is located on Batuu, in a junkyard outside of Black Spire Outpost.<br>

            <h3>The goods</h3>
            <p>
                Building lightsabers is not something The First Order occupiers in Black Spire Outpost would tolerate, so my shop is actually keeping it low-key, helping to equip Force-sensitive warriors who seeking a more elegant weapon. Guests will sign up for a build session, and can choose from assorted parts to assemble a lightsaber that is unique to their personalities. This isn't the plastic Hasbro Bladebuilder you can buy in any terrestrial store. These are a bit more detailed and advanced, with the finished hilt costing about $109.00 and the blade itself running $49.99 — just for starters.
            </p>
            <h3>Kyber crystals</h3>
            <p>
                Kyber crystals are rare gems capable of focusing and amplifying energy. They can be found on planets that have a high natural 
                concentration of Force energy, such as Jedha and Ilum. Each kyber crystal is unique and requires a Force-sensitive being to align and activate it during the lightsaber assembly process. Each kyber crystal starts out clear, but once it is awakened by the Force, its color shifts to match the nature of its master. The color of the crystal determines the color of the lightsaber's blade.

            <h3>The main colors</h3>
            <p>
                Some of the most common colors for Jedi lightsabers include blue, green, and violet. Red lightsabers are typically attuned to those who have succumbed to the dark side of the Force.
